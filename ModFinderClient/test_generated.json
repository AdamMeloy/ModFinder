This does not create a save dependency.\n\n![Test settings screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/test_settings.png)\n\n![More settings screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/more_settings.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) (UMM), minimum version 0.23.0, and configure for use with Wrath\n2. Install [ModFinder](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/ModFinder) and use it to search for Mewsifer Console\n3. Click \"Install\"\n\nIf you don't want to use ModFinder you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/releases/latest) and install normally using UMM.\n\n## Problems or Suggestions\n\nFile an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/issues/new) or reach out to me (@WittleWolfie) on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr) in #mod-dev-technical or #mod-user-general channel.\n\n## Mods Using ModMenu\n\nThis is a non-exhaustive list, let me know if you want your mod added here!\n\n* [MewsiferConsole](https://github.com/Pathfinder-WOTR-Modding-Community/MewsiferConsole)\n\n## Mod Developers\n\n### Why should you use it?\n\n* It looks nice!\n* Automatically persists your settings\n* Handles restoring defaults\n* Automatically persists per-save settings\n* Super easy to use\n\n### How to use it\n\nThe screenshot above was generated using [TestSettings](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/ModMenu/Settings/TestSettings.cs). That exercises every function supported. The API is documented and generally self-explanatory.\n\nIn your mod's `Info.json` add `ModMenu` as a requirement:\n\n```json\n\"Requirements\": [\"ModMenu\"]\n```\n\nYou should specify a minimum version:\n\n```json\n\"Requirements\": [\"ModMenu-1.1.0\"]\n```\n\nIt's safest to just specify the version you build against as the minimum version, but methods added after 1.0 do specify the version in their remarks.\n\nInstall ModMenu then in your mod's project add `%WrathPath%/Mods/ModMenu/ModMenu.dll` as an assembly reference.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n* **Do not add settings during mod load,** without additional handling you cannot create a `LocalizedString`. I recommend adding settings before, during, or after `BlueprintsCache.Init()`.\n* Don't use `IsModificationAllowed` to enable/disable a setting based on another setting. This is checked when the page is opened so it won't apply immediately.\n* Indicate settings which require reboot using `WithLongDescription()`. The game's setting boolean `RequireReboot` does nothing.\n\n### Settings Behavior\n\n* Settings with `DependsOnSave()` are associated with a save slot, but do not create save dependencies\n    * You do not need to handle saving or restoring settings at all, though save dependent settings may be lost if the mod is disabled\n* `OnValueChanged()` is called after the user clicks \"Apply\" and confirms\n* `OnTempValueChanged()` is called immediately after the user changes the value, but before it is applied\n* A setting's value can be checked at any time by calling [GetSettingValue()](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu/blob/main/ModMenu/ModMenu.cs#L85)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* A shout out to Bubbles (factsubio) who essentially wrote the new image and button settings types when I was about to give up.\n* The modding community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr), an invaluable and supportive resource for help modding.\n* All the Owlcat modders who came before me, wrote documents, and open sourced their code.\n\n## Interested in modding?\n\n* Check out the [OwlcatModdingWiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki).\n* Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wotr).\n",

Loot logic changed, took performance hit but no idea how to implement it on load area without issues with saves.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS IS VERY EARLY VERSION - it is highly likely that it will cause issue of replacing some important NPC! Toybox can most likely fix that. \n\n\n\nWhat does this mod do? Basically when a monster spawns, this mod will replace it with new one of similar kind of power level (in some cases you might roll a really hard fight). Every zone will have a theme and a backup theme chosen when loading into area from which the monsters pool is fetched first. If no match is found, then all pools are to be used. \n\nAlso all monsters have a chance to drop a random loot. Loot level is based on the CR of enemy with a roll for multipliers. \n\nThe mod has blacklisted the tutorial areas (and couple other). Also some mobs are blacklisted, but i have only played upto ~ending of act2 atm so i do not know for sure what happens in later acts with the mod on. \n\nI actually have three different models for this and this seemed most stable (other ones were replacing unit groups / units with new units, but i couldnt figure out how to have them spawn in realistic places).\n\nYou can contact me on Discord Pathfinder channel with name Ode\n\n**How to install**\n\n1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0\n2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous\n3. Download the mod\n4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab\n\n**Thanks**\n\nHambeard for creating Random equipment mod. This uses part of it for random loots. \n\nVek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked. \nBubbles and rest of the discord <3\n",
