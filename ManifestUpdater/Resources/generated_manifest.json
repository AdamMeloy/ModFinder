Unlearned scrolls and recipes and unread books will be collected using the Collect All button.\n-- Collect all items that pass a price divided by weight cutoff. The default value is 10, meaning that an item of value 10 and weight 1 would be looted, but the same item with a weight of 2 would not be. \n- New feature: Added a new filter to the inventory,  'gear for the selected character'. This filter will only show items with the same weapon, shield, and armour types as the selected character. Very useful for quickly scanning through all of your characters to pick out quick upgrades!\n- New feature: Added a new filter to the inventory, 'non-zero price and weight'. This filter will only display items with a value AND a weight above 0. Very useful to cut down on unsellable items when combined with the price / weight sorter. \n- New feature: Added an option to preventing switching to the metamagic tab after creating a new metamagic spell. This is helpful when you want to create more than one metamagic spell at the same time. (default on)\n- Change: Fixed the search bar background text when you open the inventory for the first time; it will properly display the dropdown option now.\n- Change: The spell filtering by save options should now work for users on non-English localizations.\n- Change: Some options have been relabelled to make their purpose clearer.

If you have any learnable scrolls in your inventory that the selected character can use, one click of this button will automatically learn them for you!\n- New feature: Added an 'all unlearned spells' checkbox to the spellbook UI; this will show all unlearned spells (even ones you don't already know) that match your selected searching criteria. This is handy for e.g. showing every spell you could possibly get and filtering by school or save to plan your future spells.\n- New feature: Added an option to show the spell level next to the spell icon when viewing all spell levels. (default on)\n- New feature: Added an option to hide the little grey metamagic circles above spells (default hidden), which can be very noisy when you have many metamagic feats.\n- Change: The all button has moved to a checkbox at the bottom right; this clears up user confusion, since it was not obvious the button was toggleable separately to the spell levels.\n- Change: Show all spells is now off by default. Big spellbooks can be quite slow to load, and it creates a better user experience if it is opt in.\n- Change: Changing spell levels while the all button is active will no longer trigger a complete spellbook refresh. This is helpful when you're trying to fill your spellbook up level by level while using the all spells view.\n- Change: The spell list will now reset its scroll to the top in appropriate circumstances, e.g. when toggling between spell levels or applying the various spell search and filtering options.\n- Change: Options text updated to make it more clear how to disable certain aspects of the mod (spellbook changes, inventory changes, etc).\n- Change: The spell level buttons have been relocated to the left, snug with the search bar; on some characters (wizards with a specialized school) the buttons would overlap with the school graphics and be hard to click.
